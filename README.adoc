= Motor Controller

In this project I controlled the speed of a motor, by adjusting the duty cycle of a Pulse
Width Modulated (PWM) signal. 

== Step 1: Design Implementation

This project consists of a motor with a built in tachometer,
a small circuit to convert the tachometer signal to a digital signal and a motor driver to allow the
Arduino to drive the motor. Then an RPM readout (LCD) and speed control (encoder knob) will be
displayed.

BOM::: 
 * Arduino Board
 * LCD
 * Motor

== Step 2: Load the code

Upload the code contained in this folder on to your board
